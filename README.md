# Fourier-HHG

The idea of this project is to obtain the same results as https://github.com/majesticrock/HigherHarmonics/ .
In that project, I solved the ODE and subsequently applied a Fourier transform.

Here, I try to apply a Fourier transform to the ODE, yielding an integral equation.
We will see, whether this works (better).

This variant does not seem to be more efficient than the original.
